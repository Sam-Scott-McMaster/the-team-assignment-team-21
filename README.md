# Connect Four

## Description

This application is a recreation of the popular game, Connect Four, using C with the GTK toolkit to create an interactive GUI.

Connect Four is a two-player turn-based game in which the players take turns "dropping" coloured pieces into a board containing six rows and seven columns. Each player is assigned a certain colour and the goal of the game is to connect four of the same coloured pieces in a row, either diagonally, vertically, or horizontally.
